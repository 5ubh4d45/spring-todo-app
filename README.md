# SpringBoot Todo App

## Description
This is a simple todo app built with SpringBoot and Thymeleaf. It uses an file based [H2 database](/data/)
to store the todo tasks. I built this app to learn SpringBoot and Thymeleaf.


## Thymeleaf Endpoints
The app is deployed at **PORT:8080**.

Thymeleaf endpoint is at http://localhost:8080.

## API Endpoints
It also has a REST API at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/todo-items.
